======================

To get a PDF version of the CAS Server Manual in English, run `makepdf en` and a file called
`casmanual.en.pdf` will appear in the root of the project. `makepdf` required
pandoc and XeTeX as dependencies.

* `config.yml`: this is a simple configuration file which allows you to
  specify language-specific customisations.
* `template.tex`: this is the main LaTeX file which determines the style of the
  PDF version of the book. Its contents is run through the ERB templating
  language to include language-specific customisations from config.yml.
