A stab at formal Jasig CAS project documentation using Markdown, which may be more satisfying than DocBook.

# Casually Perusing #

GitHub will do a decent but not perfect job of rendering the Markdown pages.  The actual pages are in the _en_folder.  Start at [the introduction](https://github.com/apetro/CAS-Documentation/blob/master/en/01-introduction/01-chapter1.markdown), e.g.

Hit the "raw" link to view [the raw source](https://raw.github.com/apetro/CAS-Documentation/master/en/01-introduction/01-chapter1.markdown) of that page, and appreciate readability and writeability of raw Markdown source.

You can also download an [already built PDF].  No promises on whether the source has improved since that PDF was posted.

# Building #

Currently, supports building to pdf via the _makepdfs_ script (colocated with this README).  It takes a little doing to get that script to run, but it's feasible.  If it proves too frustrating, please do at least take a look at the [already built PDF].
